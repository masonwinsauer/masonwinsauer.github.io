title: The Museum - A collection of unedited daily entries by Mason Winsauer.

Welcome to the museum. Included in your pass today are three semi-permanent exhibits.

1. The galleria of false memories.
2. The garden of fleeting serenity.
3. A faithful reconstruction of what a gift shop for a museum such as this might theoretically have. No items are for sale.

The Museum's architect, curator, and exhibit creator, Aldus Masterson, welcomes you. He would do so personally if he were able. However, he is currently occupied with other duties.
