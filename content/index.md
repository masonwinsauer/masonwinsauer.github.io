title: The Window

Welcome to the museum. Included in your pass today are three semi-permanent exhibits.

1. The galleria of false memories.
2. The garden of fleeting serenity.
3. A faithful reconstruction of what a gift shop for a museum such as this might theoretically have. No items are for sale.
