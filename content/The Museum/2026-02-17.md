The blackness was absolute. She wondered if her eyes hadn't adjusted, but they never did. Even in her advanced years, Sandra had retained her senses well. Her training directed her movement more than her rationale. She immediately spun against the wall to her left, a mental map exploding from the darkness. The map was incomplete, but it allowed her to quickly position herself advantageously relative to an intruder. To a human intruder, that is. She feared those tactics were useless if what now shared the inky quiet was unbound by such things. 

Quiet, but not silence. There was something new on the edge of her awareness. A rhythmic thrumming - One that was felt, not heard. Her chest cavity, the fluid in her brain, the length of her femurs were the microphones picking up the body-length screams being produced. The reverberations seemed inescapable in this chamber of sculptural ecstasy.

Sandra was suddenly aware that a warm liquid was running down her chin, becoming cold as it reached the converging lines of her neck. Even as she felt for the source, her fingers couldn't distinguish an origin, just an increasing number of places where her skin was now slippery. The thrumming was all-consuming. It now overwhelmed her completely. She sunk to the ground as her sense of balance was exsanguinated alongside her vitality.
